Routes to traverse-:

localhost:3000/api/v1/auth  to login and get a authroization token
localhost:3000/api/v1/posts/index by passing the authorization token to view the content
localhost:3000/api/v1/posts/create to insert data element using post request.

All the actions are performed using Postman and create operation might show error but its working correctly.
